# Claim Academy Java Book Store

BookStore App for learning Java Web development
---

**Introduction**
The goal of this project is to integrate SQL queries, database interfacing, front-end management, Object-Relational frameworks, secure logins, and MVC design patterns into an web application that will allow for the organization, display, and purchasing of online books. In this repo, you will find many examples of working code, as well as many of the imags and front-end resources that you will need to complete the finished project. Your goal, though, should be to complete as much of this finished project using your own designs and solutions as possible, and to add any features that *you* would like to see in a bookstore application.

**Part 1**
DUE SATURDAY, AUGUST 1st

The focus for the first week should be on database creation and a Data Access Layer. Presentations on Saturday will focus on the exhibition of a RESTful service that manages subsets of books in the database. Objectives include:

1) set up a well-organized database that stores the following: 
  + Unique # IDs for each book (like ISBNs)
  + Book Titles
  + Author Names (first and last)
  + Cover Image URL (It's OK to link some book cover images available online)
  + Year of Book Publishing
  + Book genre/category
  + Brief Book Description
  + Purchase Price

2) set up a Data Access Layer that allows an administrative user to perform the following:
  + Add books to the database
  + Modify information about current books
  + Delete books
  + Get subsets and categories of books


**Part 2**
DUE SATURDAY, AUGUST 8th

The focus of the second week on this project will be the integration of MVC patterns into your existing bookstore service. Technologies learned will include Struts and Spring, but your project may use any technology you would like to create the interface between data and users. Objectives include:

1) cohesive mapping of database using Object-Relational Database mapping

2) implementation of MVC design patterns to allow users to interact with the existing service


**Part 3**
DUE SATURDAY, AUGUST 15th

To further explore security and logging, your final set of objectives will be tied to the completion of a shopping cart that will allow certain users to purchase and interact with books while protecting the information held in the database about those books. Objectives include:

1) implementation of user authorization and user profiles

2) design and implementation of shopping cart functionality, designed according to robust security design patterns

3) refactor existing code according to additional design patterns
